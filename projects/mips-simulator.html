        <h2> <u> Project Description: </u> </h2>
        <p>
            This project involved developing a MIPS processor simulator in C that emulates the execution of MIPS assembly instructions. 
            The simulator reads machine instructions from an input file, decodes them, and updates registers and memory to reflect instruction execution. 
            It models key components of a MIPS architecture, including the program counter, register file, and control logic. The project strengthened 
            understanding of computer architecture concepts and low-level system behavior through hands-on implementation. Notice how in the images above, 
            the $t0 register changes after the first instruction is executed. The program counter $pc increments by 4 as well, which is the normal behavior in MIPS
            after each instruction is executed.
