        <p>
            Project Nile is a Java-based, event-driven application that simulates an enterprise 
            inventory and shopping cart system. Users can search for items, add them to a cart, 
            and process transactions while maintaining inventory logs. The project emphasizes 
            practical business logic and user interaction through a graphical user interface (GUI). 
            It demonstrates real-world software development practices in a contained, hands-on project environment.

            In the images above, the user is searching for an item. The item was found, so it appeared into the details field. The user then added it
            to the cart, before checking out. Once the user checked out, it generated an invoice, as well as logged it into a csv file.
