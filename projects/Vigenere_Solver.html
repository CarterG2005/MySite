        <h2> <u> Project Description: </u> </h2>
        <p> This Project consists of 3 programs used to break the Vigenere Cipher: </p>
        <h3> 1. Index of Coincidence Analyzer (IOC.java) </h3>
        <p>
            This program computes the Index of Coincidence (IoC) for a ciphertext and uses it to estimate the most likely key length of a Vigenère cipher. 
            The IoC measures how unevenly letters are distributed in a piece of text. Natural languages like English have a higher IoC than random text, so splitting the ciphertext 
            into periodic groups (based on a guessed key length) reveals which key lengths produce English‑like distributions.
            <br>
            <strong> What this program does: </strong>
        </p>
        <ul> 
            <li> Calculates the IoC of the entire ciphertext </li>
            <li> Tests key lengths from 1 to 20. </li>
            <li> Splits the ciphertext into groups based on each candidate key length </li>
            <li> Computes the average IoC across all groups </li>
            <li> Highlights key lengths whose IoC values approach that of English text (~0.065), helping the user narrow down the correct key length </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p> In the output above, key length of 10 is closest to the value of english text, so its highly likely that the key length is 10. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3> 2. Mutual Index of Coincidence Analyzer (MIC.java) </h3>
        <p> Once a likely key length is known, this program uses the Mutual Index of Coincidence (MIC) to determine the actual key letters. 
            It compares the frequency distribution of each ciphertext group (formed by taking every k‑th letter) against known English letter frequencies.
            <br>
            <strong> What this program does: </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>  
            <li> Computes the relative frequency of each letter </li>
            <li> Tests all 26 possible Caesar shifts for each letter in the key </li>
            <li> Calculates the MIC between the shifted group and English frequencies. </li>
            <li> Selects the shift that produces the highest MIC value </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p> The output gives the best shift for each letter in the key. The numerical value corresponds to a letter (a=0, b=1, c=2, ...) </p>
        <p> From this, we can get the key word. 0 = a, 25 = z, .... 13 = n. Our key is azerbaijan.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3> 3. Vigenère Decryption Tool (VigenereDecrypt.java) </h3>
        <p>
            After determining the key, this program performs the final step: decrypting the ciphertext. 
            It applies the standard Vigenère decryption formula, shifting each letter backward by the corresponding key letter.
            We can plug our ciphertext and keyword into this program and it will decrypt it for us.
